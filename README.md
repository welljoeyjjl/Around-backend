# Around-backend

**A Cloud and React based Social Network with Geo-index and Image Recognition**

•	Built a scalable web service in Go to handle posts and deployed to Google Cloud (GAE flex) for better scaling

•	Utilized ElasticSearch (GCE) to provide geo-location-based search functions such that users can search nearby posts within a distance (e.g. 200km)

•	Used Google Dataflow to implement a daily dump of posts to BigQuery table for offline analysis

•	Used Google Cloud ML API and Tensorflow to train a face detection model and integrated with the Go service
